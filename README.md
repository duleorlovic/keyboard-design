List of useful shortcuts which human should use with their keyboards. Similar to Material design for web, this is design for keyboard.

Copy paste keyboard shortcuts are not the only one which can save your time.
Here is a list of different situations on which you can use shortcut:

## Switch windows

Using Alt+Tab (or cmd+Tab) is not efficient if you have multiple applications with multiple windows and you want to switch to specific window.

For Linux there is `xdotool` with which you can add classes to windows, search and activate.
For MAC you can use AppleScript to tell Application to activate specific window id.

## Text shortcuts

For bash command line you can use Ctrl shortcuts.
For Mac you can use Option + delete to delete last word.

## CLI commands

Copy command line to clipboard
